# Rails API backend preconfigured

> To goal of this project is to have a production-ready deploy of an Rails 4 API backend in a few minutes.

It is a blank Rails app, preconfigured with:
- basic authentication via token ([Devise] + [CanCan] + [Devise Token Auth]);
- full deploy setup ([Capistrano] + [nginx] + [puma]);
- auto generate SSL certificate for HTTPS (and auto renew) with [Let's Encrypt]﻿; 
- gems for API testing and documentation ([RSpec API documentation] + [Apitome]);
- basic administration backend ([ActiveAdmin]);
- CORS and URL regex ([rack-cors]);
- API versioning via headers.


Deployment stack is the following:
- Rails 5;
- Capistrano 3;
- nginx configured via Capistrano task;
- Puma configured via Capistrano task;
- crontab with [whenever];
- asynchronous jobs with [delayed-job]﻿;
- auto backups for PostgreSQL;
- environment variables with [figaro];
- error notification with [airbrake]﻿;
- both production and staging environments configured for Capistrano/nginx/puma.


See wiki article on how setup the server accordingly (TODO).

# Frontend

## Password reset

[Password reset flow]

- ng-token-auth will [POST /api/auth/password] with two params: email and redirect_url.
- Backend will send an email to the user with a reset url.
- When user click on the link in the email, backend validates the token and redirect to frontend (redirect_url), passing a 6 hours temporary session (uid, token, client_id...) that let the user to change his password.
